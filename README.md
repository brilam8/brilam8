### Hi there, I'm Brian!

I'm a Computer Science student studying at **UC San Diego**, and an aspiring software engineer. Lately, I have been focusing on back-end development for numerous projects but have delved into front-end development and design in the past!
<br></br>

I have put thousands of hours and a lot of love into my open-source projects as well as contributing towards others' open-source projects, which you can find here, on my Github! Some of my favorites are pinned below and while I still maintain most of my projects, some have been shelved to make more time for newer, more developed projects as I learn more about my studies! 

âš¡ Fun fact: Some of my projects were created when I first started learning the foundations of programming in my freshman year of High School!

You can see a more detailed list of my favorite projects at my website [here](http://www.lambrian.me/)!

Going all the way back, my endeavors with programming all started with Roblox game development, in which I attempted to design, model, and build my own survival Roblox game. Unfortunately I never got a chance to finish my game, but if you want to take a trip back in time, you can visit my (now broken) game and all of its assets at: [A New World](https://www.roblox.com/games/274671982/A-New-World).
